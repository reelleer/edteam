# Vuex for Everyone

About the course

In this course you'll learn all there is to know about Vuex by creating a shopping cart from scratch.

We will start off by creating a shopping cart with Vue and then progressively dive into Vuex features as we need them. Piece by piece we'll replace parts of our application with mutations, getters, and actions.

You'll also learn how to break your Vuex store into modules.

After this course, you will know when and how to use getters, mutations, actions and, how to split your Store with modules.

If you want to learn how you can put your new Vuex skills to use in a real-world application, you can check out The Vue.js Master Class.
