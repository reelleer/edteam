# Vue Router for Everyone

## About the course

Learn how to create powerful Vue.js Single Page Applications (SPA’s) with the Vue Router in this course.

Single Page Applications are web apps or sites that interact with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page rather than loading entire new pages from the server.

This approach allows us to only fetch the data/section of our page that is needed when a user interacts with our app. By dynamically rewriting smaller chunks of our site, it prevents us from re-downloading already loaded resources such as the images, scripts, CSS, etc.

As a result SPA’s tend to improve the user experience due to its impressive page load speed performance and behave more like desktop applications.

In this course, you’ll learn everything you need to know about the Vue Router to either create rapid prototypes or ımpressive, full-blown Vue.js SPA’s.
